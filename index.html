    <section class="">
    I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, advised by Michael 
                Wellman. I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and Economics from University of Chicago and a master's degree in statistics 
                from University of Michigan. My most recent industry experiences have been at Google  New York (differential privacy research) and MITRE (speaker clustering using an HMM).

                Recently I have been studying how strategic interactions in financial networks should inform banking regulatory reform. 
                More broadly I am interested in using computational tools from applied game theory, graph mining,
                and machine learning to find insights in economic systems. 

                


                     
<!-- My research focuses on bridging the gap between economic theory and real-world reasoning agents. In my agent-based approach to economic modeling, I allow agents to process richer information and make more complex decisions. In particular, agents in my models can affect their environment appreciably, and they choose how to do so strategically. I build these models while maintaining the ability to compute approximate economic equilibria. This allows me to analyze the state of entire economic systems given strategic agent behavior and make recommendations on the design of these systems. So far, I have applied this methodology to analyze models of social trust networks as well as the boom/bust nature of asset markets.
<br><br>

More generally, I am interested in using computational tools to augment our ability to understand economics. This includes designing better algorithms as well as using data to better inform models of strategic agents. At Google, I researched algorithms for differential privacy, which is important if we want to calibrate economic models using sensitive data. I have also researched ways to use deep learning to represent an agent's placement in a social graph. -->
